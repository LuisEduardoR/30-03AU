# 30.03AU

by Luís Eduardo Rozante de Freitas Pereira

**30.03AU** is a simple space-shooter game I made back in 2018 as part of a recruitment process to join **Fellowship of the Game**, a study group of my university (Universidade de São Paulo - Campus de São Carlos) focused on learning game development.

I found the project looking through some old files and decided to release it to the public, all game assets and code where created by myself using the Unity Engine, Visual Studio Community, Audacity, Krita and GIMP.
